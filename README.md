This is the source code of website for the group project on Nanotechnology undertaken by the students of NIIT University. The topic was 
Suspended Gates Silicon Nanodots Memory.
We students researched about the growing competition on SSD's and flash memory, replacing the traditional HDD and predicting the future 
scope of how nanotechnology will impact the storage devices on a larger scale
